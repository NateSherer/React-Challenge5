This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React, allowing two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O), with the game determining the winner or if it ends in a draw. The project  displays the current status of the game (next player or winner), and allows players to jump to previous moves. 
To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install the dependencies with npm install
Start the development server using npm start 
Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to play. 
The code structure includes App.css for styles, App.jsx for the main component with game logic, a Square component for individual squares, a Board component for the grid and game logic, and a Game component for managing game state and history.

How to Play
Click on any square to place your mark (X or O).
The game will alternate turns between players.
The game will display the winner or indicate if the game is still ongoing.
You can click on the move history to jump back to previous moves.
